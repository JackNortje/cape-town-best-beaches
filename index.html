      Introduction
    </header> 

    <article>
      <p>Cape Town is the second-most populous city in South Africa, after Johannesburg, and also the legislative capital of South Africa.

    Colloquially named the Mother City, it is the largest city of the Western Cape province and forms part of the City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality. The Parliament of South Africa is situated in Cape Town. The other two capitals are located in Gauteng (Pretoria the executive capital where the Presidency is based) and in the Free State (Bloemfontein the judicial capital where the Supreme Court of Appeal is located). The city is known for its harbour, for its natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region, and for landmarks such as Table Mountain and Cape Point. Cape Town is home to 49% of the Western Cape's population. The city was named the World Design Capital for 2014 by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design.</p>

    <p>In 2014, Cape Town was named the best place in the world to visit by both The New York Times and The Daily Telegraph. Cape Town has also been a host city for both the 1995 Rugby World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup, and annually hosts the Africa leg of the World Rugby 7s.</p>

    <p>Located on the shore of Table Bay, Cape Town, as the oldest urban area in the Western Cape, it was developed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as a supply station for Dutch ships sailing to East Africa, India, and the Far East. Jan van Riebeeck's arrival on 6 April 1652 established the VOC Cape Colony, the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the Castle of Good Hope, becoming the economic and cultural hub of the Cape Colony. Until the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the development of Johannesburg, Cape Town was the largest city in South Africa.</p>

     <p>Made up of four absolutely gorgeous white-sand beaches backed by smooth granite boulders known as the Twelve Apostles, the beaches at Clifton are Cape Town's most tony and trendy. Some of the city's most expensive real estate overlooks these beaches, which are accessed by steep sets of stairs from the main road about six kilometers from the city center. Each is set in its own cove and protected from wind by giant boulders, making them ideal for sun-bathing.</p>

   <p>Named for the order in which they are encountered coming from Cape Town, each beach has its own distinct vibe. Head to First Beach if you want some peace and quiet. It is usually less crowded. It is also off-leash dog-friendly, should you be traveling with a pup. This beach has decent surf under the right conditions and attracts body-boarders on hot summer days.</p>

  <p>Second Beach attracts a younger crowd and has an active summer volleyball scene.

  Third Beach is Clifton's gay beach but is open to everyone. The beach is often less crowded than the others and has a buzzy atmosphere.

  Fourth Beach is the largest and most trendy of the Clifton beaches and attracts a mix of families, groups of friends, and couples. It also boasts coveted Blue Flag status, which is awarded for clean water, safety, and environmental management. It also has views of Cape Town's second most famous peak, Lion's Head.</p>

      <p>Vying with Clifton for Cape Town's top beach status is Camps Bay. The only reason we placed it second here is that Clifton offers a little more protection from Cape Town's infamous wind. Located just around the corner from Clifton, Camps Bay is also a Blue Flag beach.</p>

    <p>The beach is long and wide and easy to access, although parking can be difficult on summer weekends when it gets very crowded - take public transport or an Uber to not have to worry about finding a spot to park. It is just across the road from a string of restaurants and caf√©s, making it easy to grab lunch between sunbathing sessions. Camps Bay also has great views of the Twelve Apostles and Lion's Head.</p>

    <p>If you want to stay in Camps Bay, check out South Beach Camps Bay. The luxe boutique hotel is one of our favorites in all of South Africa. Inspired by the Miami art scene, it features contemporary white-on-white decor in its 19 suites, which all face the sea and come with either balconies or private patio areas. They also come with fully equipped kitchens, including fridges that are stocked daily with breakfast items (included in the rate).

    Other perks of staying at South Beach include two swimming pools, an on-site gym, and bikes for guests to use. Make sure to check out the art around the property. It is all original by well-known South African artist Lionel Smit.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Just about 20 kilometers south of Cape Town heading towards Hout Bay, Llandudno Beach is where the locals go to escape the crowds at Clifton and Camps Bay. Located down a narrow windy road off the highway in a ritzy hillside neighborhood, it is a favorite for beach picnics; sunbathing; and, if you can brave the cold Atlantic temperatures, body boarding and surfing.

    Like other Atlantic coastline beaches, its westerly location means it gets gorgeous nightly sunsets.</p>

    <p>There are no restaurants or shops around this beach, so you'll need to pack in everything you want to use for the day with you, including chairs, umbrellas, and snacks. The beach itself is wide and set in a cove filled with soft sand that is good for building sandcastles. Llandudno is popular with families, groups of friends, and couples alike. On summer weekends, it can get crowded, so arrive early for a good spot.</p>

      <p>About 20 kilometers to the north of Cape Town's city center on the Atlantic coast, Blouberg comprises a few different beaches, including Dolphin Beach, Small Bay, and Big Bay. If you are into kitesurfing, head to Big Bay, which is one of the top spots in the world for the sport. The beach also hosts an international kitesurfing competition annually.</p>

    <p>Small Bay is where to head for fewer crowds. It attracts a lot of families, and kids will love making sand castles in the soft sand here.

    This area is also perfect for snapping a postcard-worthy photo of one of Cape Town's most famous attractions, Table Mountain. The city is built around the 6,000-foot-high table-shaped mountain in its middle, and from Blouberg, you get an unobstructed view. The west coast location also makes for stunning sun-setting-into-the-ocean photographs.</p>

      <p>It is about a 15-minute walk from the shops and restaurants at Kalk Bay to St. James Beach on the False Bay seafront. The small beach is a perfect pick for families, as there are shallow rock pools for the kids to splash around in that are warmer than the open ocean. The beach is also sheltered from wind and big waves.</p>

    <p> Like Muizenberg, St. James also has a picture perfect row of multi-colored wooden beach huts that make popular social media photo shoot backdrops. Kalk Bay is located about 30 minutes' drive from downtown Cape Town and is a historic harbor and small town that is a popular local day-trip destination.</p>
